generate_certs.py - Fresh Picks: SSL Certificate Generator
============================================================
Run this script ONCE to generate two files:
  - cert.pem  (the "Digital ID Card" — public identity of the server)
  - key.pem   (the "Private Key"     — secret used to encrypt/decrypt)

These two files together enable HTTPS on our Flask server.

HOW TO RUN:
  cd Fresh-Picks/app
  pip install cryptography
  python generate_certs.py

WHAT GETS CREATED:
  Fresh-Picks/app/cert.pem   <- Give this to anyone who wants to verify you
  Fresh-Picks/app/key.pem    <- NEVER share this. Keep it secret.

  DEVELOPER GLOSSARY (Read this once — it will make sense!)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  SSL / TLS:
    SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and its modern replacement TLS
    (Transport Layer Security) are protocols that ENCRYPT the
    data travelling between a browser and our server.

    Without SSL:  Browser → [username=alice&pass=1234] → Server
                  Anyone on the same Wi-Fi can READ this with a
                  tool like Wireshark. This is called a
                  "Man-in-the-Middle" (MITM) attack.

    With SSL:     Browser → [X#@!$%^&*9kQ2...] → Server
                  The data is scrambled. Only our server (holding
                  key.pem) can unscramble it. Safe on public Wi-Fi!

  Certificate (cert.pem):
    Think of this as our server's "Digital ID Card" or "Passport."
    It contains:
      - Our server's public key (used by browsers to encrypt data)
      - Our server's identity info (name, organization)
      - A validity period (expiry date)

    A REAL certificate is issued and signed by a trusted authority
    like DigiCert or Let's Encrypt. Browsers trust these.

  Self-Signed Certificate:
    Since we are a student project, we SIGN our own cert —
    like writing your own recommendation letter.
    The browser knows it wasn't signed by a trusted authority,
    so it shows a "⚠️ Your connection is not private" warning.
    This is EXPECTED and NORMAL for local/demo use.

    HOW TO BYPASS FOR DEMO:
      Chrome/Edge: Click "Advanced" → "Proceed to <IP> (unsafe)"
      Firefox:     Click "Advanced" → "Accept the Risk and Continue"

  key.pem (Private Key):
    This is the "master key" that decrypts everything the browser
    sends using our certificate. NEVER commit this to GitHub.
    It should be in your .gitignore file.

  RSA 2048-bit:
    The encryption algorithm we use. 2048-bit refers to the key
    size — like a password that is 617 digits long. Unbreakable
    with current computers.

    PURPOSE: Generate an RSA private key.

    RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is a public-key cryptography algorithm.
    It generates a KEY PAIR:
      - Private Key (key.pem): kept secret on the server
      - Public Key  (embedded in cert.pem): shared with everyone

    HOW ENCRYPTION WORKS WITH THIS PAIR:
      1. Browser gets our public key from cert.pem
      2. Browser encrypts its data using the public key
      3. Only our private key (key.pem) can decrypt it
      → Even if someone steals the encrypted data, they can't
        read it without key.pem

    public_exponent=65537:
      A standard value used in RSA. Think of it as a parameter
      in the math formula. 65537 is chosen because it's fast
      to compute and cryptographically secure.

    key_size=2048:
      The size of the key in bits. 2048-bit = ~617 decimal digits.
      The larger the key, the harder it is to crack.
      2048-bit is the current industry standard minimum.

    PURPOSE: Build and self-sign an X.509 certificate.

    X.509 is the standard format for SSL/TLS certificates.
    It's like a form with fields:
      - Who is this certificate for? (Subject)
      - Who issued/signed it?        (Issuer — same as Subject for self-signed)
      - When does it expire?         (Validity period)

    SELF-SIGNED means:
      Normally, a Certificate Authority (CA) like DigiCert checks
      your identity and then signs your certificate with their
      trusted key. Browsers trust those CAs by default.

      Since we are signing it ourselves (subject == issuer),
      browsers don't recognize our "authority" — hence the warning.
